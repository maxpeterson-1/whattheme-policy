# Privacy Policy for WhatTheme

**Last Updated:** July 8, 2025

## 1. The Basics

"WhatTheme" ("the Extension") is a browser extension designed with a single purpose: to identify the Shopify theme used by a website. Your privacy is fundamental. We do not collect, store, sell, or share any of your personal data.

## 2. Data We Do Not Collect

To be perfectly clear, we **do not** collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

*   Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, or location.
*   Authentication information like passwords or credentials.
*   Your web history or browsing activity.
*   Any user activity like clicks, mouse movements, or keystrokes.
*   Any personal communications.

## 3. Data We Interact With

The Extension's sole function requires it to read one specific piece of non-personal information from the active webpage's source code: the `Shopify.theme` object.

*   **What is read:** The name of the Shopify theme.
*   **How it's used:** This information is displayed directly to you, the user, within the extension's popup window.
*   **Storage:** This information is not stored, logged, or transmitted to any server. It is discarded as soon as the popup is closed.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy in the future if the extension's functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected in a new version of the policy.

## 5. Contact
